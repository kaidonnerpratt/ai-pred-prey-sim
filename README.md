# ai pred prey sim

this is a program that simulates ai predators and prey to see who comes out on top.


# description

when a predator(pred for short) overlaps with a prey, it flashes yellow and the prey dies. This is called "eating" the prey. If a pred eats 5 prey, it duplicates. All code here(the ai, the simulation..) was made by me unless specified otherwise.

# Problems and bugs

If their are any problems plese contact me. A problem is:

* bug
* crash
* errors

A problem is not:

* lag
* bad code(sorry)
* preds always lose(I am working on this though)


# TODO:

* fix lag issues
